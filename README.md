# Giving-for-a-reason
Giving for a reason is a website impacting the social issue of poverty and helping the organisation 'YouShareYouCare' help the ones who are really in need. The website is developed using WordPress. YouShareYouCare is a non-profitable philanthropic organisation which aims at bringing a change in the way an individual can donate. Be it clothes, money, food or books, we take the initiative to get it from your doorstep and make sure it reaches the deserving, the less fortunate through transparent methods.
